This project is a mini-game application designed to offer users a collection of fun and engaging mini-games hosted on the server. It provides an interactive platform where players can connect, explore, and enjoy different games without needing to install them individually. The goal is to create a smooth and responsive gaming experience while keeping the setup lightweight and accessible from any supported device.

The application focuses on simplicity, performance, and scalability, making it easy to add new mini-games over time. By leveraging server-side logic, it ensures fair gameplay and seamless synchronization between users. Whether you're looking to play casually or compete with friends, this project aims to deliver a user-friendly and entertaining gaming environment that can continue expanding with community-driven contributions.
